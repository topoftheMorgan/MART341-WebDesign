## Things I've Learned
I have learned more of the basics of how the internet works.
I have relearned how to make repostories in GitHub (I have to relearn every time ðŸ˜…).
I have also learned what cookies really are. Ive always been told that they are really bad for your computer, but i can still see how things can go wrong withcookies if their power is abused
